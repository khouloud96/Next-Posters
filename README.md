# Next-Posters
It's a platform where you can add posters and read some others' feed.

It's based on NextJS:

* Data mutation (sending, storing & changing data)
* Integrated NextJS app (no seperate backend)
* useFormStatus
* useFormState 


##Using cloudinary to store files

- upload the cloudinary.js file which contains all the code needed to take an image file and uploaded to cloudinary into a folder named "next-posters-images"
- add .env.local file in your root project folder in order to set up your environment variables related to cloudinary
